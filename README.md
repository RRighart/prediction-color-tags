# prediction-color-tags

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used to predict color tags. Automated tagging is important for various industries such as e-commerce and sport.
The present repo shows how an efficientnet, a special kind of CNN, is trained on available vehicle data (VCOR data available at Kaggle) and has good performance on validation and hold-out testdata. Several example images show it may generalize to other non-vehicle categories.
